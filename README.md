##  About Ham Sandwich Cuts

Given two objects $A$ and $B$ in $\R^2$, a (2D-)ham sandwich cut is a line $l$ such that $A$ is bisected by $l$ and $B$ is bisected by $l$.


In this demonstration we include sets consisting of points, lines, or $2$-dimensional polytopes, although it is certainly possible to apply ham sandwich cuts to a broader class of objects.
In fact, Ham sandwich cuts can also be generalized to $d$ dimensions where $d$ objects are bisected by a hyperplane in $\R^d$, however in this application we limit ourselves to objects in $\R^2$.


Given a line $l$, and two point sets $A$ and $B$, one can determine if $l$ is a ham sandwich cut of $A$ and $B$ in linear time.
Therefore, a naive algorithm would be to try every line determined by a pair of points from $A\times B$.
This is worst-case cubic to compute.

Ham sandwich cuts of two finite point sets in the plane was solved optimally in $O(n)$ time by Lo et. al [1].
Their approach is to find a point in the dual setting that lies above and below at most half of the dual lines.

Ham sandwich cuts of the area of two non-intersecting polygons was solved optimally by Stojmenovic in 1991 [2].
